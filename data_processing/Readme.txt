Data Processing Module with Docker Support
This repository contains a Python module for data processing and a Dockerfile to create a Docker container for running the data processing script. The provided module, data_processing.py, performs data processing on input data and stores the processed results in an SQLite database. Additionally, the Dockerfile is provided to build a Docker image containing the necessary dependencies to run the data processing script.

Prerequisites
Before running the Docker container, ensure that you have Docker installed on your system.

Usage
Data Processing Module
Modify the data_processing.py module to suit your specific use case. Update the file paths, data processing logic, and other parameters as needed.

Test the data processing module locally:



python data_processing.py
Docker Container
Clone the repository to your local machine:



git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
Navigate to the repository directory:



cd your-repo
Build the Docker image:



docker build -t data-processing-app .
Run the Docker container:



docker run -v /path/to/local/csv/directory:/app -it data-processing-app
Replace /path/to/local/csv/directory with the absolute path to the directory containing your financial_data.csv and financial_data.db files.

Module Overview
The data_processing.py module performs data processing on input data and stores the processed results in an SQLite database. Here's a brief overview of its functionality:

Imports necessary modules: os, pandas, logging, sqlite3, datetime, sklearn, sqlalchemy.
Implements functions for data processing, table creation, data retrieval, and table name retrieval.
Demonstrates data processing with a test input data set and date range.
Logs process information and error messages.
Dockerfile Overview
The Dockerfile is provided to build a Docker image for the data processing module. Here's a summary of the Dockerfile's contents:

Uses the official python:3.8-slim image as the base.
Sets the working directory to /app within the container.
Copies the data_processing.py script, financial_data.csv, and financial_data.db files to the container.
Installs the required dependencies (pandas, scikit-learn, sqlalchemy) using pip.
Specifies the command to run when the container is launched (python data_processing.py).
