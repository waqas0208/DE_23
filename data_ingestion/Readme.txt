Data Ingestion Module with Docker Support
This repository contains a Python module for data ingestion and a Dockerfile to create a Docker container for running the data ingestion script. The provided module, data_ingestion.py, performs data ingestion from a CSV file and stores the data in an SQLite database. Additionally, the Dockerfile is provided to build a Docker image containing the necessary dependencies to run the data ingestion script.

Prerequisites
Before running the Docker container, ensure that you have Docker installed on your system.

Usage
Data Ingestion Module
Modify the data_ingestion.py module to suit your specific use case. Update the file paths and adjust any data processing logic as needed.

Test the data ingestion module locally:



python data_ingestion.py
Docker Container
Clone the repository to your local machine:



git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
Navigate to the repository directory:



cd your-repo
Build the Docker image:



docker build -t data-ingestion-app .
Run the Docker container:



docker run -v /path/to/local/csv/directory:/app -it data-ingestion-app
Replace /path/to/local/csv/directory with the absolute path to the directory containing your financial_data.csv file.

Module Overview
The data_ingestion.py module performs data ingestion from a CSV file and stores the ingested data in an SQLite database. Here's a brief overview of its functionality:

Imports necessary modules: os, pandas, logging, sqlite3.
Implements the data_ingestion function for data ingestion.
Implements the create_database function to create an SQLite database.
Demonstrates data ingestion with a test CSV file.
Logs process information and error messages.
Dockerfile Overview
The Dockerfile is provided to build a Docker image for the data ingestion module. Here's a summary of the Dockerfile's contents:

Uses the official sqlite:latest image as the base.
Copies the financial_data.db database file to the container.
Copies the data_ingestion.py script and requirements.txt file to the container.
Specifies the working directory within the container.
Specifies the command to run when the container is launched (sqlite3 financial_data.db).
Requirements
The requirements.txt file lists the necessary Python modules required by the data ingestion script. Make sure to keep this file up to date with any additional dependencies your script may require.
