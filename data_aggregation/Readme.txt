Data Aggregation Module with Docker Support
This repository contains a Python module for performing data aggregation and a Dockerfile to containerize the module. The provided module, data_aggregation.py, aggregates input data and stores the aggregated results in an SQLite database. Additionally, the Dockerfile is provided to build a Docker image containing the necessary dependencies to run the data aggregation script.

Prerequisites
Before running the Docker container, ensure that you have Docker installed on your system.

Usage
Data Aggregation Module
Modify the data_aggregation.py module to suit your specific use case. Update the file paths and adjust any data processing logic as needed.

Test the data aggregation module locally:



python data_aggregation.py
Docker Container
Clone the repository to your local machine:



git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
Navigate to the repository directory:



cd your-repo
Build the Docker image:



docker build -t data-aggregation-app .
Run the Docker container:



docker run data-aggregation-app
Module Overview
The data_aggregation.py module performs data aggregation and stores the aggregated results in an SQLite database. Here's a brief overview of its functionality:

Imports necessary modules: time, logging, pandas, sqlite3.
Defines file paths for CSV data, database, and log file.
Configures logging for capturing process information.
Implements the aggregate_data function for data aggregation.
Demonstrates data aggregation with a test input data set.
Logs process information and error messages.
Dockerfile Overview
The Dockerfile is provided to build a Docker image for the data aggregation module. Here's a summary of the Dockerfile's contents:

Uses the official python:3.8-slim image as the base.
Sets the working directory to /app within the container.
Copies the data_aggregation.py script and requirements.txt file to the container.
Installs the required dependencies (pandas) using pip.
Specifies the command to run the script (python data_aggregation.py) when the container is launched.
Requirements
The requirements.txt file lists the necessary Python modules required by the data aggregation script. Make sure to keep this file up to date with any additional dependencies your script may require.
